Greetings!

My name is Olivia Morales, and I'm an upcoming graduate of the University of Florida, set to receive a Master of Arts in Education with a concentration in 
Student Personnel in Higher Education. Throughout my graduate career, I've been interested in examining higher education institutions as enginesof social and 
economic mobility, particularly for historically marginalized populations. As a result, I've created this website to hold writings and visualizations pertaining 
to my master's project re: economic mobility, affordability and America's public institutions. 

Thank you so much for visiting!
