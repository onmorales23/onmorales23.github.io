The following project utilizes data published by the not-for-profit organization Opportunity Insights, housed at Harvard University. The data are featured in a project entitled *Mobility Report Cards: Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility Across Colleges in the United States*, where Raj Chetty and colleagues leveraged multiple data sources (tax, 1098-T and Pell grant records) to measure intergenerational economic mobility from 1999 to 2013. For this research endeavor, I used the economic mobility measure to evaluate the U.S. higher education system's ability to propel student graduates economically. 

How is economic mobility measured? In Opportunity Inisights's Dataverse Repository Codebook, **economic mobility** is defined as the "percent of students who have parents in the Bottom 20% of the income distribution and reach the Top 20% of the income distribution" (Chetty et al., 2017). Economic mobility rates were calculated for each institution in the data set for each year available in the 1999-2013 time span. 

To hone in closer to the policy implications of such an index, I specifically limited the dataset to public 2- and 4-year institutions; my hope is to highlight the public sector's role in promoting economic mobility amongst the most economically vulnerable students (and all for a more affordable net price). The variable **aggaverage** is the median economic mobility rate for each institution in the dataset.

To gauge institutional affordability, I created an index that measured affordability in terms of the maximum Pell grant's ability to cover the cost of attendance of the institution (2013 dollars; 5645/CoA). I then created the variable **stateaff** as the median affordability measure for each state.
