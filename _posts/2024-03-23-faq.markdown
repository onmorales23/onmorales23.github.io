The following project utilizes data published by the not-for-profit organization Opportunity Insights, housed at Harvard University. The data are featured in a project entitled *Mobility Report Cards: Income Segregation and Intergenerational Mobility Across Colleges in the United States*, where Raj Chetty and colleagues leveraged multiple data sources (tax, 1098-T and Pell grant records) to measure intergenerational economic mobility from 1999 to 2013. For this research endeavor, I used the economic mobility measure to evaluate the U.S. higher education system's ability to propel student graduates economically.
